        li Kiara is a phoenix, a mythical fire bird creature who revives if killed.
        li In her introduction, her backstory stated that she would be reborn in a different dimension every time she dies. However, on 10 December 2020 during her "re-debut" stream, Kiara claimed to have mastered revival, as she was reborn again in the same dimension, which is fine by her as long as Calli is there.
        li Her belt can turn her back into her phoenix form; as such, she is prohibited from using it.
        li
          | Kiara's hair can ignite when she's angry. In school, she would handle this by running to the bathroom and dunking her head in the toilet. She can control this better as an adult. Her belt helps prevent this from happening.[79]
          ul
            li Kiara has â‚¬500,000 in debt from unpaid fines for accidentally setting off fire alarms. Despite this, she managed to secure investment to launch KFP by just not telling anyone.
        li In her previous lives, Kiara has held many jobs, including a shrine maiden, an idol, a race car driver, an air hostess, a personal trainer, and a warrior.
        li Once, in a previous life, Kiara died after being hit by a train.
        li Kiara's blue feather "earrings" are in fact not earrings, but feathers which come from behind her ears. However, she also has a small blue stud piercing in her left ear.
        li
          | According to her introduction video, Kiara was born in a time before humans lived on Earth. This makes her potentially the oldest hololive member at the time of her debut, at least several hundred thousand to several million years old depending on the definition of "human" in the evolutionary tree.
          ul
            li Potentially older members include Ceres Fauna (4.54 billion years old), Tsukumo Sana (13.8 billion years old), Ouro Kronii (infinity), and Mori Calliope (who is the personification of an abstract concept and has no date of birth).
            li However, as Kiara is technically reborn every few centuries, it could be argued that Kiara was only born relatively recently.
            li Following her re-debut on 10 December 2020 JST, Kiara officially died and was reborn, technically making her the youngest hololive member at age 0. Himemori Luna was arguably joint youngest at age 0, but she would still be older than Kiara by two months until Luna's next 0th birthday of 10 October 2021.
        li
          | Phoenixes live longer than humans. In Kiara's April 1st stream, Come closer and listen, youngling..., a grandma Kiara (nicknamed Kibaba) had lived for over 3,000 years. hololive had closed down by this point after being shut down by a mysterious organization.
          ul
            li Predictions made by Kibaba included hololive Myth meeting in Japan (her favorite memory) and wearing matching pajamas (Kiara's idea), her original album, a holomyth concert featuring a very emotional slow version of Journey of a Thousand Years, and a Kiara solo live concert.
            li Future Kibaba has a second house for her 231 cats, including a new cat named Bonkers and an alien cat from Mars. Ina is still alive in this timeline and lives near Kiara, who cooks her food so she doesn't just eat cup noodle and sleep on the floor. Ame became part of hololive management before returning to time travel and hang out with aliens. Gura looks more grown-up and became president of Atlantis. Calli left Hell and became an angel instead. Yagoo commutes between Heaven and Hell because he's looking for someone in particular. Kiara saved Jenma's life by giving her one of her phoenix feathers. Twitter still exists in the future after KFP bought it out and changed the blue bird logo into an orange Kotori, but rivals Snapchat, TikTok and Instagram have shut down. The EN Curse is still active, but nobody ever found the cause.
        li Kiara's cats are also phoenix cats.
