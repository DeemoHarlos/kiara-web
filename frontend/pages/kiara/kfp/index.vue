        li Kiara is the CEO of a fast food franchise called Kiara Fried Phoenix, or KFP for short.
        li
          | Her employees are chickens. After a year, they are fried and served to customers. Kiara assures employees that the company's products are made with vegan chicken, and missing employees have merely been transferred to another branch.
          ul
            li After they are cooked, Kiara is able to return to life in a form similar to Kiara's mascot, Kotori.
            li Employees may choose their own salary, but they pay their salary to Kiara, instead of the other way around. Other employee benefits include German lessons, unlimited chicken nuggets for life, and Kiara will beat up anyone you have a beef with.
            li Employees are various sizes, with some small enough for Kiara to hold them in her hands. The largest employee on record is 69 metres (226 feet) tall, and is tasked with stomping rival fast food restaurants to the ground.
        li Kiara is known by the title tenchou, "store manager." Since KFP expanded from a single store to a franchise, her title should technically be shachou, company president; however, she still goes by "tenchou."
        li
          | On 17 September 2020, Kiara announced the menu for KFP. It included the Phoenix Burger (chicken meat, salad, pineapple, BBQ sauce, onions, tomato, bacon, and mozzarella cheese); and the Yagoo Burger (two beef patties, salad, pickles, egg, cheddar cheese, secret seiso sauce, and onion rings). Fans subsequently actually made both burgers.
          ul
            li On 3 April 2022, KFP revealed and updated menu. It included the new Kotori Burger, consisting of crispy fried chicken patty, lettuce, tomato x2, bacon, optional cheddar sauce, and a mayonnaise base sauce.
        li Kiara uses the hashtags #WOKE and #YOLK. As established during the Fire Emblem streams, these stand for Watch Only Kiara Everyday, and You Only Love Kiara.
        li Kiara denies that KFP is a cult.
        li
          | Kiara often threatens to send misbehaving employees to a place called the Usual Room. The Usual Room contains a jigsaw with one piece missing, screens which play Kiara music videos 24/7, and pro-KFP propaganda for "re-education". The floor is covered in Lego.
          ul
            li Someone once found the missing jigsaw piece and gave it to Kiara. She promptly destroyed it to maintain the status quo.
            li Each Usual Room is unique to the individual employee.
        li The notion that KFP employees are all chickens was popularized after a Minecraft prank by Gawr Gura on 15 November 2020, where she filled the back room of Kiara's KFP building with chickens. On 17 November, Ina was checking on the chickens when a creeper exploded in the KFP building, releasing the chickens. Ina attempted to return them to the room by staging a new employee orientation event. Kiara found out three days later and "fired" Ina for killing chicken employees.
        li
          | Kiara's office at KFP headquarters features in her superchat (tangent) reading streams.
          ul
            li Features include Kiara's spare uniforms, a "Best Boss" mug, a Kotori mug, all five holomyth plushies, a Holotalk poster, VHS tapes of previous Holotalk episodes, vinyl singles of Kiara's original songs and covers, a fishbowl with Kiara's "am frog" by Mamaloni, a "menu ideas" board, TV screens showing Kiara's music videos and her original 2020 stream intro animation, a mousehole for Casper, books titled "How to Run a Business" and "How to Run a Cult for Dummies", Usual Room release forms (stamped "DENIED"), Kiara's sword, her cats Smoothie and Chonkers, a picture of the first Smol Myth collab, and framed pictures of Kiara with her oshi Pekora, O'Riends, Holobirbs, and holoMyth (labeled "FAMILY").
            li The office changes with the seasons. In spring, it has cherry blossom petals falling outside. A KFP employee can occasionally be seen throwing the petals.
        li All branches of KFP have ramps. This is partly for wheelchair accessibility, but also because it's fun to Naruto-run down the ramps.
        li The chicken KFP employee who serves as DJ on Kiara's stage scene is named D. Chicken.
